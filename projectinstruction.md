# CPSC 471 - Socket Programming Project

## Goals

- Understand the challenges of protocol design
- Discover and appreciate the challenges of developing complex, real-world network applications
- Make sense of real-world sockets programming
- Utilize a sockets programming API to construct a simplified FTP server and client

## Submission Guidelines

This assignment may be completed using **C++**, **Java**, or **Python**.

Please hand in your source code electronically (do not submit `.o` or executable code) through Canvas. You must make sure that this code compiles and runs correctly.

- Only one person within each group should submit

### README Requirements

Write a README file (text file, do not submit a `.doc` file) which contains:

- Names and email addresses of all team members
- The programming language you use (e.g., C++, Java, or Python)
- How to execute your program
- Anything special about your submission that we should take note of

### Submission Process

1. Place all your files under one directory with a unique name (such as `p1-[userid]` for assignment)
2. Tar the contents of this directory using the following command (Linux):
   ```bash
   tar cvf [directory_name].tar [directory_name]
   ```
3. Use CANVAS to upload the tarred file you created

## Grading Guideline

| Component | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| Protocol design | 10 |
| Program compiles | 5 |
| Correct `get` command | 25 |
| Correct `put` command | 25 |
| Correct `ls` command | 10 |
| Correct format | 5 |
| Correct use of the two connections | 15 |
| README and Report file included | 5 |

**Note:** Late submissions shall be penalized 10%.

## Study Guide

For the project, each of you should study the following:

- Study the related contents about File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
- Study socket programming
- Study the FTP related system calls in the language you chose
- Refer to the sample code and start your own design
